Much of the ML that is being adopted by the mechanics community was initially developed for application outside of science and engineering, and has the potential to produce results of questionable physical validity. To ensure that these data-driven approaches are trustworthy, there is a clear need to embed physical principles into their architectures, to evaluate and compare ML frameworks against benchmark datasets, and to test their broader extensibility. Frameworks must be grounded in a clear objective, quantifiable error, and a well-defined scope of extensibility. These principles enable ML models with a wide range of architectures to be meaningfully categorized, compared, evaluated, and extended to broader experimental and computational frameworks. Application of these principles are demonstrated through an investigation of ML models in two different use cases, acoustic emission and resonant ultrasound spectroscopy, along with a discussion of outlooks for the future of trustworthy ML in experimental mechanics.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509623000352
Evolution TANN and the identification of internal variables and evolution equations in solid mechanics,"['Filippo Masi', 'Ioannis Stefanou']","Volume 174, May 2023, 105245","['Deep Learning', 'Internal variables', 'Constitutive modeling', 'Evolution equations']","Data-driven and deep learning approaches have demonstrated to have the potential of replacing classical constitutive models for complex materials, displaying path-dependency and possessing multiple inherent scales. Yet, the necessity of structuring constitutive models with an incremental formulation has given rise to data-driven approaches where physical quantities, e.g. deformation, blend with artificial, non-physical ones, such as the increments in deformation and time. Neural networks and the consequent constitutive models depend, thus, on the particular incremental formulation, fail in identifying material representations locally in time, and suffer from poor generalization.
Herein, we propose a new approach which allows, for the first time, to decouple the material representation from the incremental formulation. Inspired by the Thermodynamics-based Artificial Neural Networks (TANN) and the theory of the internal variables, the evolution TANN (eTANN) are continuous-time and, therefore, independent of the aforementioned artificial quantities. Key feature of the proposed approach is the identification of the evolution equations of the internal variables in the form of ordinary differential equations, rather than in an incremental discrete-time form.
In this work, we focus attention to juxtapose and show how the various general notions of solid mechanics are implemented in eTANN. The laws of thermodynamics are hardwired in the structure of the network and allow predictions which are always consistent, independently of the range of the training dataset.
Inspired by previous works, we propose a methodology that allows to identify, from data and first principles, admissible sets of internal variables from the microscopic fields in complex materials. The capabilities as well as the scalability of the proposed approach are demonstrated through several applications involving a broad spectrum of complex material behaviors, from plasticity to damage and viscosity (and combination of them). Finally, we show that the proposed approach can be used to speed-up state-of-the-art multiscale analyses, by virtue of asymptotic homogenization. eTANN provide excellent results compared to detailed fine-scale simulations and offer the possibility not only to describe the average macroscopic material behavior, but also micromechanical, complex mechanisms.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509623000492
Discovery of quasi-disordered truss metamaterials inspired by natural cellular materials,"['Akash Singh Bhuwal', 'Yong Pang', 'Ian Ashcroft', 'Wei Sun', 'Tao Liu']","Volume 175, June 2023, 105294","['Metamaterials', 'Brittle to progressive failure', 'Artificial neural network']","Natural cellular materials, such as marine mussels, honeycombs, woods, trabecular bones, plant parenchyma, sponges and protoreaster nodosus, may benefit from the disorderliness within their internal microstructures to achieve damage tolerant behaviors. Inspired by this, we have created quasi-disordered truss metamaterials (QTMs) via introducing spatial coordinate perturbations or strut thickness variations to the perfect, periodic truss lattices. Numerical studies have suggested that the QTMs can exhibit either ductile, damage tolerant behaviors or sudden, catastrophic failure mode, depending on the distribution of the introduced disorderliness. A data-driven approach has been developed, combining deep-learning and global optimization algorithms, to tune the distribution of the disorderliness to achieve the damage tolerant QTM designs. A case study on the QTMs created from a periodic Face Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice has demonstrated that the optimized QTMs can achieve up to 100% increase in ductility at the expense of less than 5% stiffness and 8%–15% tensile strength. Our results suggest a novel design pathway for architected materials to improve damage tolerance.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509623000984
Generative multiscale analysis of de novo proteome-inspired molecular structures and nanomechanical optimization using a VoxelPerceiver transformer model,"['Zhenze Yang', 'Yu-Chuan Hsu', 'Markus J.

The proteomic molecular designs generated by MolShapeGAN model are examined using LAMMPS coarse-grained simulations by applying tensile deformation to the longest axis of each structure, to assess mechanical properties. In order to facilitate nanomechanical optimization, we develop a transformer neural network, denoted as VoxelPerceiver, that predicts mechanical properties directly from the molecular architecture in an end-to-end fashion. The assessment of key nanomechanical properties, such as maximum tensile stress, Von Mises stress mean, and Von Mises standard deviation, offer a materiomic design paradigm by which tailored nanomechanical properties can be achieved, and by which important insights can be gained about the particularities of nanomechanical responses of molecular structures. Optimization to achieve desired mechanical properties is performed both using a brute-force grid search and Bayesian optimization. We also report manufactured samples of scaled-up architected models of the protein designs using 3D printing.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509622002757
Modeling finite-strain plasticity using physics-informed neural network and assessment of the network performance,"['Sijun Niu', 'Enrui Zhang', 'Yuri Bazilevs', 'Vikas Srivastava']","Volume 172, March 2023, 105177","['Physics-informed neural networks (PINN)', 'Machine learning', 'Finite element method (FEM)', 'Finite-deformation', 'Plasticity']","Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) can solve partial differential equations (PDEs) by encoding the mathematical information explicitly into the loss functions. In the context of plasticity, discussions of PINN have only focused on small-strain formulations. We present a framework of finite-strain elasto-plasticity for PINN, considering rate-independent isotropic hardening in this work. Details of the model architecture are discussed, including inputs and outputs of the neural network and the construction of the loss function that incorporates equilibrium equations, boundary conditions and constitutive relations. In addition, the overall architecture can learn the constitutive relations from discrete measurements on a stress–strain curve, hence eliminating the need for modeling hardening law in the formulation. We demonstrate the performance of PINN through a numerical example that includes a multi-step loading and unloading history. Moreover, we assess the performance of PINN in terms of its accuracy and robustness under mesh refinement and as a function of the network architecture design. Displacement, Cauchy stress and accumulated plastic strain fields are compared to the finite element results for the same problem for the purposes of this assessment, which is intended to provide insight and guidance for the future designs of PINN for plasticity and related problems in solid mechanics.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509622003532
"Scaling in size, time and risk—The problem of huge extrapolations and remedy by asymptotic matching","['Zdeněk P. Bažant', 'Hoang T. Nguyen', 'A. Abdullah Dönmez']","Volume 170, January 2023, 105094","['Fracture mechanics', 'Size effect on strength', 'Creep and shrinkage', 'Water diffusion', 'Cement hydration', 'Failure probability', 'Experimental databases', 'Concrete structures']","The scaling of structural response of concrete structures to large structure sizes, to long service lives and to tolerable failure probabilities is a problem of order-of-magnitude extrapolations, which are intractable by AI and machine learning and require significant theoretical advances. The present review, based on a lecture at Yonggang Huang’s 60th birthday symposium in Houston, summarizes the recent advances, with a focus on those achieved at Northwestern University. Reliable extrapolation requires two-sided asymptotic matching. Most existing databases provide support on only one extreme of the range of size, time or failure probability, but theoretical support can be obtained for the asymptotic behaviors on both sides of the range. The advantage is that the asymptotics are much simpler than the behavior in the central, transitional, range. In closing it is explained that realistic extrapolations are required to mitigate the calamitous CO

A computational study of bio-chemo-mechanics of thrombus-laden aneurysms,"['Lana Virag', 'Nino Horvat', 'Igor Karšaj']","Volume 171, February 2023, 105140","['Growth and remodelling', 'Abdominal aortic aneurysm', 'Intraluminal thrombus', 'Proteolytic activity', 'Finite element method']","The role of intraluminal thrombus (ILT) in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) development has been controversial for decades, yet the researchers and clinicians agree that thrombus is not an innocent bystander in disease progression. In an effort to increase our understanding of its role, in this work, we present a bio-chemo-mechanical mathematical model of thrombus-laden aneurysms. Unlike all previous finite element studies, where AAAs grow due to prescribed irreversible time-dependent elastin degradation, in this study, protein degradation depends on protease activity. Enzymes degrading collagen and elastin are believed to come from the luminal layer of intraluminal thrombus and the increasing area of chemotactic vasa vasorum in the wall. The geometrical and structural spatiotemporal changes in the aneurysmal wall at the apex and shoulder region of the thrombus-laden aneurysm are explained in detail. Furthermore, we show that later ILT formation is more perilous than its early deposition, despite lower peak protease activity and related extracellular matrix degradation. Interestingly, the radial growth rate is slightly slower for fully thrombosed AAAs compared to the partially thrombosed ones, however, their axial growth is much more pronounced. Additionally, we show that thrombus deposition greatly impacts the aneurysmal sac shape and volume.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509622003167
Computation of effective elastic moduli of rocks using hierarchical homogenization,"['Rasool Ahmad', 'Mingliang Liu', 'Michael Ortiz', 'Tapan Mukerji', 'Wei Cai']","Volume 174, May 2023, 105268","['Digital rock physics', 'Elastic moduli', 'Homogenization', 'FFT solvers', 'Renormalization']","This work focuses on computing the homogenized elastic properties of rocks from 3D micro-computed-tomography (micro-CT) scanned images. The accurate computation of homogenized properties of rocks, archetypal random media, requires both resolution of intricate underlying microstructure and large field of view, resulting in huge micro-CT images. Homogenization entails solving the local elasticity problem computationally which can be prohibitively expensive for a huge image. To mitigate this problem, we use a renormalization method inspired scheme, the hierarchical homogenization method, where a large image is partitioned into smaller subimages. The individual subimages are separately homogenized using periodic boundary conditions, and then assembled into a much smaller intermediate image. The intermediate image is again homogenized, subject to the periodic boundary condition, to find the final homogenized elastic constant of the original image. An FFT-based elasticity solver is used to solve the associated periodic elasticity problem. The error in the homogenized elastic constant is empirically shown to follow a power law scaling with exponent
with respect to the subimage size across all five microstructures of rocks. We further show that the inclusion of surrounding materials during the homogenization of the small subimages reduces error in the final homogenized elastic moduli while still respecting the power law with the exponent of

A framework to simulate the crack initiation and propagation in very-high-cycle fatigue of an additively manufactured AlSi10Mg alloy,"['Jingyu Sun', 'Guian Qian', 'Jianghua Li', 'Ruiyang Li', 'Zhimo Jian', 'Youshi Hong', 'Filippo Berto']","Volume 175, June 2023, 105293","['Crystal plasticity', 'Cohesive zone model', 'Very-high-cycle fatigue', 'Microstructure-sensitive fatigue', 'Short crack growth']","Currently, no systematic approach exists to simulate the crack initiation and propagation process in very-high-cycle fatigue including the microstructure sensitivity. A combined crystal plasticity and cohesive zone model based computational framework is developed to simulate the defect-induced short crack growth of an additively manufactured AlSi10Mg alloy. The crystal plasticity formulation is used to model the anisotropic deformation in the grains. The accumulated plastic shear strain obtained by the crystal plasticity is introduced into the cohesive zone model as the crack initiation damage evolution criteria. The total damage is suggested to be divided into static damage, fatigue initiation damage and fatigue propagation damage. The framework can control the crack growth rate and the proportion of crack initiation damage in the total damage. Besides, an acceleration strategy is proposed to accelerate the computational efficiency for the very-high-cycle fatigue (VHCF). It provides an equivalence of loading cycles and the computational efficiency and accuracy are controlled by the acceleration factor. The internal defect induced short crack initiation and propagation of VHCF are investigated experimentally and simulated by the proposed framework. Experimental observations of tortuous crack paths and fine grain regions are reasonably well captured by the simulation.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509623000972
