Machine-learning based prediction of crash response of tubular structures,"['Emmanouil Sakaridis', 'Nikolaos Karathanasopoulos', 'Dirk Mohr']","Volume 166, August 2022, 104240","['Artificial neural network', 'Machine learning', 'Crashworthiness', 'Buckling transition', 'Imperfection sensitivity']","This paper proposes a machine learning based methodology for predicting the buckling response of tubular structures. An extensive dataset of force-time curves is generated using a calibrated finite element model within a parametric space where buckling response is highly non-linear. Based on a fully connected neural network template, the machine learning hyper-parameters are determined and the resulting model is evaluated on a separate test set, with regard to maximum and average load and energy absorption errors. This evaluation shows a non-random error distribution which can be correlated with the physical properties of the structural collapse. To validate this assumption, a similar error analysis is conducted between finite element simulations with varying geometric imperfections. Evaluation of imperfection sensitivity reveals a similar error distribution and comparison of individual curves shows that errors made by the neural network model have a physical interpretation. These results indicate that the proposed machine learning based approach is capable of predicting the crushing response with a level of accuracy comparable to the errors that would be caused by a minor change in geometric imperfection.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734743X22000860
Parameter determination for ice material model based on a bidirectional long short-term memory neural network,"['Dacheng Li', 'Xiongwen Jiang', 'Wei Zhang', 'Licheng Guo']","Volume 161, March 2022, 104110","['Ice material', 'Impact test', 'Finite element method', 'Inverse method', 'LSTM neural network']","Parameter determination is a common problem in engineering activities. For impact problems subjected to ice projectiles, however, very few researches have addressed the inverse method to determine the material parameters of ice for finite element simulations. The present study introduced a novel method based on a sequence-to-sequence bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to learn the relationship between the input impact force histories and output material parameters of the finite element model, which was built to reproduce the ice impact test using a hollow tube sensor. After the trained network was evaluated by testing data set, the experimental data was used to predict the parameters for the numerical model to precisely match the test results.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734743X21002979
Progressive fracturing of concrete under biaxial confinement and repetitive dynamic loadings: From damage to catastrophic failure,"['H.C. Wang', 'J. Zhao', 'J Li', 'C.H. Braithwaite', 'Q.B. Zhang']","Volume 165, July 2022, 104232","['Concrete', 'Repetitive dynamic loadings', 'Progressive fracturing', 'Micro-CT', 'Digital volume correlation (DVC)']","Concrete materials are frequently exposed to extreme environments, such as high confining pressures (e.g., deep underground support), dynamic loadings (e.g., natural phenomena and human-induced events), and coupled confinement and dynamic loadings. The behaviours of concrete materials under such conditions result in challenges for the diagnosis and prognosis of structural changes from local damage to catastrophic failure, which is critical to the safety and sustainability of civil infrastructures. This paper aims to explore mechanical properties and progressive fracturing of concrete materials subjected to biaxial confinement and repetitive dynamic loadings. A triaxial Hopkinson bar (Tri-HB) system is used to apply the coupled loading conditions, and obtain the dynamic stress-strain information by interpreting recorded stress-wave signals. Non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques, including ultrasonic measurement and synchrotron-based micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), are utilised to quantify progressively damage evolution and fracture characteristics. The digital volume correlation (DVC) and imaging processing techniques are further applied to compute volume deformation fields and to classify microcrack types (i.e., matrix crack, interfacial crack and transgranular cracks). Results show that, with increasing the number of impacts, dynamic peak stress decreases along the impact direction but increases along the lateral direction while the peak strain values increase in both directions. The microcracks firstly initiate at the middle of rear-end of the specimen, continuously propagate along the impact direction, then develop at the top and bottom of the specimen, and eventually coalesce with the occurrence of shear sliding. The observation of microcracks are well validated by ultrasonic measurement. The formation of shear bands was highly dependent on the propagation and coalescence of interfacial and matrix cracks, while transgranular cracks induced by compressive strain localization as displayed in DVC deformation fields play an essential role in the fracture energy under repetitive dynamic loadings.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734743X22000781
The phase-field simulations of blasting failure in granites,"['Sijia Liu', 'Zaiquan Wang', 'Yongjun Zhang', 'Miaomiao Kou', 'Jing Bi']","Volume 167, September 2022, 104274","['Phase-field model', 'Blasting failure', 'Dynamic crack propagation', 'Blasting load', 'Granites']","In this study, an explicit phase-field model with new mixed-mode fracture driving forces is developed to simulate the blasting fracture phenomena in granites. The new fracture driving forces make our new phase-field model able to capture pure tensile crack, pure shear cracks and other mixed-mode tensile/compressive-shear cracks in rock/rock-like materials. To validate the correctness and accuracy of our new dynamic phase-field framework, two benchmarked examples, i.e., a Kalthoffâ€“Winkler test and a laboratory borehole blasting experiment, are performed by the qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Furthermore, a series of borehole blasting tests of granites are simulated by our new numerical model. The effects of blast loading parameters (i.e., peak pressure, loading rate and blasting attenuation) and mineral components on the dynamic failure characteristics of granites, including ultimate failure patterns, breakage ratio, energy evolution, peak particle velocity, are systematically investigated. Overall, this study not only offers a useful computational tool to the researchers in rock mechanics, but also provides deep insights on the dynamic rock fracture to the engineers in rock engineering.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734743X22001208
