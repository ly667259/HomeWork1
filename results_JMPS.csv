Dynamic fracture of a bicontinuously nanostructured copolymer: A deep-learning analysis of big-data-generating experiment,"['Hanxun Jin', 'Tong Jiao', 'Rodney J.

We first describe a new Dynamic Line-Image Shearing Interferometer (DL-ISI), which uses a streak camera to record optical fringes of displacement-gradient vs time profile along a line on sample's rear surface. This system enables us to detect crack initiation and growth processes in plate-impact experiments. Then, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep-learning framework, trained by extensive finite-element simulations, that inversely determines the accurate DCPs from the DL-ISI fringe images. For the measurements, plate-impact experiments were performed on a set of samples with a mid-plane crack. A Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) was employed first to reconstruct missing DL-ISI fringes with recorded partial DL-ISI fringes. Then, the CNN and a correlation method were applied to the fully reconstructed fringes to get the dynamic fracture toughness,

The dynamic cohesive strength is found to be nearly three times higher than the dynamic-failure-initiation strength. The high dynamic fracture toughness is found to stem from both high dynamic cohesive strength and high ductility of the dynamic cohesive separation. These experimental results fill a gap in the current understanding of nanostructured copolymer's cooperative-failure strength under extreme local loading conditions near the crack tip. This experiment demonstrates the advantages of a big-data-generating experiment to extract unprecedented details of nanostructured material's dynamic fracture characteristics with deep-learning algorithms.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509622001016
Deep learning in frequency domain for inverse identification of nonhomogeneous material properties,"['Yizhe Liu', 'Yuli Chen', 'Bin Ding']","Volume 168, November 2022, 105043","['Modulus identification', 'Inverse problem', 'Discrete cosine transform', 'Deep learning']","The inverse identification of nonhomogeneous material properties from measured displacement/strain fields, especially when noise exists, is crucial for both engineering and material science. The conventional physics-based solutions either require time-consuming iterative calculations, or are sensitive to noise. While the new machine learning methods either need excess data for high-dimensional matchups, or mainly apply to case-by-case analyses with informed physics. In this paper, to solve the complex matchup between the measured displacement/strain fields and the randomly distributed modulus field rapidly and robustly, a novel method of deep learning in frequency domain is proposed, with discrete cosine transform (DCT) to achieve frequency domain transformation as well as dimensionality reduction and convolutional neural network (CNN) to implement learning in frequency domain. Results show that our method not only has high prediction accuracy on zero-noise samples (with L1-error of 4.249%) but also presents great robustness to noise (with L1-error of 5.085% on large-noise samples). Besides, by our method, only one-time training on a dataset with mixed noise is basically enough to deal with arbitrary levels of noise (with L1-errors below 5.202%), improving the efficiency significantly in practical applications. Moreover, our method can be directly transferred to neighbor sampling spaces with different sampling points, showing a great generalization. The study provides a powerful approach for inverse identification of material properties and promises for wide applications such as real-time elastography and high-throughput non-destructive evaluation techniques.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509622002228

In contrast to supervised learning, which assumes the availability of stress–strain pairs, the approach only uses realistically measurable full-field displacement and global reaction force data, thus it lies within the scope of our recent framework for Efficient Unsupervised Constitutive Law Identification and Discovery (EUCLID) and we denote it as NN-EUCLID. The absence of stress labels is compensated for by leveraging a physics-motivated loss function based on the conservation of linear momentum to guide the learning process. The constitutive model is based on input-convex neural networks, which are capable of learning a function that is convex with respect to its inputs. By employing a specially designed neural network architecture, multiple physical and thermodynamic constraints for hyperelastic constitutive laws, such as material frame indifference, material stability, and stress-free reference configuration are automatically satisfied. We demonstrate the ability of the approach to accurately learn several hidden isotropic and anisotropic hyperelastic constitutive laws – including e.g., Mooney–Rivlin, Arruda–Boyce, Ogden, and Holzapfel models – without using stress data. For anisotropic hyperelasticity, the unknown anisotropic fiber directions are automatically discovered jointly with the constitutive model. The neural network-based constitutive models show good generalization capability beyond the strain states observed during training and are readily deployable in a general finite element framework for simulating complex mechanical boundary value problems with good accuracy.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509622002538

Much of the ML that is being adopted by the mechanics community was initially developed for application outside of science and engineering, and has the potential to produce results of questionable physical validity. To ensure that these data-driven approaches are trustworthy, there is a clear need to embed physical principles into their architectures, to evaluate and compare ML frameworks against benchmark datasets, and to test their broader extensibility. Frameworks must be grounded in a clear objective, quantifiable error, and a well-defined scope of extensibility. These principles enable ML models with a wide range of architectures to be meaningfully categorized, compared, evaluated, and extended to broader experimental and computational frameworks.

This requires the repeated solution of computationally expensive finer-scale models, and often a priori knowledge of those aspects of the finer-scale behavior that affect the coarser scale (order parameters, state variables, descriptors, etc.). We address this challenge in a two-scale setting where we learn the fine-scale behavior from off-line calculations and then use the learnt behavior directly in coarse scale calculations. The approach builds on the recent success of deep neural networks by combining their approximation power in high dimensions with ideas from model reduction. It results in a neural network approximation that has high fidelity, is computationally inexpensive, is independent of the need for a priori knowledge, and can be used directly in the coarse scale calculations. We demonstrate the approach on problems involving the impact of magnesium, a promising light-weight structural and protective material.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509621002982
Constructing growth evolution laws of arteries via reinforcement learning,"['Minliang Liu', 'Liang Liang', 'Hai Dong', 'Wei Sun', 'Rudolph L. Gleason']","Volume 168, November 2022, 105044","['Vascular growth', 'Reinforcement learning', 'Hypertensive remodeling', 'Residual stress', 'Kinematic growth']","Growth evolution laws, which mathematically describe how living tissues change their shape and properties in response to external stimuli, are required for modeling arterial growth. Traditionally, specific forms of growth laws are devised by domain experts. Since in vivo animal studies usually provide limited experimental data, generalization and inference are often employed to prescribe the functional form of growth laws. In this work, we employed the finite growth theory and developed a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to construct growth evolution laws by formulating the arterial growth problem under the framework of the Markov decision process (MDP). To maintain homeostatic stress levels in an optimal manner, RL agents were employed to determine stress-modulated anisotropic growth evolution at each time step. We illustrate the capabilities of the RL-based growth laws in two representative applications: 1) predicting homogenous growth of a thin-walled artery in response to hypertensive blood pressure, and 2) generating residual stress with heterogeneous growth in a thick-walled bi-layer aorta via distributed growth policies. Experimental data, where available, were used to compare expert-prescribed and RL-based growth laws. Our results demonstrated the capabilities of RL to effectively control the growth processes in response to hypertension, and the predictions are in good agreement with experimental observations. In particular, the RL growth laws captured the reduction of in vivo axial stretch without using experimental data for training. Moreover, the distributed RL growth policies achieved residual stress generation in a collaborative manner, which may pave the way for implementation in a finite element setting. This study sheds light on a new avenue to uncover growth evolution laws via RL, perhaps reducing the need for large experimental datasets and expert intelligence during growth law construction.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002250962200223X

Specifically, these two potentials are learned from spatio-temporal measurements of macroscopic observables via proposed neural network architectures that strongly enforce the satisfaction of the second law of thermodynamics. The method is applied to three distinct physical processes aimed at highlighting the robustness and versatility of the proposed approach. These include (i) the phase transformation of a coiled-coil protein, characterized by a non-convex free-energy density; (ii) the one-dimensional dynamic response of a three-dimensional viscoelastic solid, which leverages the variational formulation as a tool for obtaining reduced order models; and (iii) linear and nonlinear diffusion models, characterized by a lack of uniqueness of the free energy and dissipation potentials. These illustrative examples showcase the possibility of learning partial differential equations through their variational action density (i.e., a function instead), by leveraging the thermodynamic structure intrinsic to mechanical and multiphysics problems.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509622000692
Evolution TANN and the identification of internal variables and evolution equations in solid mechanics,"['Filippo Masi', 'Ioannis Stefanou']","Volume 174, May 2023, 105245","['Deep Learning', 'Internal variables', 'Constitutive modeling', 'Evolution equations']","Data-driven and deep learning approaches have demonstrated to have the potential of replacing classical constitutive models for complex materials, displaying path-dependency and possessing multiple inherent scales. Yet, the necessity of structuring constitutive models with an incremental formulation has given rise to data-driven approaches where physical quantities, e.g. deformation, blend with artificial, non-physical ones, such as the increments in deformation and time. Neural networks and the consequent constitutive models depend, thus, on the particular incremental formulation, fail in identifying material representations locally in time, and suffer from poor generalization.
Herein, we propose a new approach which allows, for the first time, to decouple the material representation from the incremental formulation. Inspired by the Thermodynamics-based Artificial Neural Networks (TANN) and the theory of the internal variables, the evolution TANN (eTANN) are continuous-time and, therefore, independent of the aforementioned artificial quantities. Key feature of the proposed approach is the identification of the evolution equations of the internal variables in the form of ordinary differential equations, rather than in an incremental discrete-time form.
In this work, we focus attention to juxtapose and show how the various general notions of solid mechanics are implemented in eTANN. The laws of thermodynamics are hardwired in the structure of the network and allow predictions which are always consistent, independently of the range of the training dataset.
Inspired by previous works, we propose a methodology that allows to identify, from data and first principles, admissible sets of internal variables from the microscopic fields in complex materials. The capabilities as well as the scalability of the proposed approach are demonstrated through several applications involving a broad spectrum of complex material behaviors, from plasticity to damage and viscosity (and combination of them). Finally, we show that the proposed approach can be used to speed-up state-of-the-art multiscale analyses, by virtue of asymptotic homogenization. eTANN provide excellent results compared to detailed fine-scale simulations and offer the possibility not only to describe the average macroscopic material behavior, but also micromechanical, complex mechanisms.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509623000492

Here we design a physics-driven machine learning (PD-ML) algorithm to map the temperature, stress and rate-dependent deformation in Li-metal. We demonstrate that the PD-ML model, fed with limited experimental results, can predict the mechanical response of Li-metal in a wide span of temperature and deformation rate, and help to realize a deformation map of Li-metal with high fidelity. A finite element (FE) procedure based on the PD-ML constitutive model is then developed. The integration of PD-ML with FE procedure inherits the power of FE analysis and the accuracy originated from PD-ML in describing temperature, stress and rate-dependent mechanical response of Li-metal.

Numerical studies have suggested that the QTMs can exhibit either ductile, damage tolerant behaviors or sudden, catastrophic failure mode, depending on the distribution of the introduced disorderliness. A data-driven approach has been developed, combining deep-learning and global optimization algorithms, to tune the distribution of the disorderliness to achieve the damage tolerant QTM designs. A case study on the QTMs created from a periodic Face Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice has demonstrated that the optimized QTMs can achieve up to 100% increase in ductility at the expense of less than 5% stiffness and 8%–15% tensile strength.

The data-driven framework of DMN is discussed in detail about the offline training and online extrapolation stages. Analytical solutions of the 3D building block with a two-layer structure in both small- and finite-strain formulations are derived based on interfacial equilibrium conditions and kinematic constraints. With linear elastic data generated by direct numerical simulations on a representative volume element (RVE), the network can be effectively trained in the offline stage using stochastic gradient descent and advanced model compression algorithms. Efficiency and accuracy of DMN on addressing the long-standing 3D RVE challenges with complex morphologies and material laws are validated through numerical experiments, including 1) hyperelastic particle-reinforced rubber composite with Mullins effect; 2) polycrystalline materials with rate-dependent crystal plasticity; 3) carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites with fiber anisotropic elasticity and matrix plasticity.

We aim to establish the basic micromechanical principles of deep material networks, shed light on the characteristics of the building blocks and introduce a simple, robust and fast solution technique for inelastic deep material networks.
In their original formulation, DMNs are solely trained by linear elastic data, but applied to nonlinear and inelastic problems with astonishing accuracy. We clarify this phenomenon theoretically by showing that, to first order in the strain rate, the effective inelastic behavior of composite materials is determined by linear elastic localization. Our argumentation applies to arbitrary microstructures comprising nonlinear generalized standard materials at small strains. The main technical tool is a Volterra series approximation of the stress of a generalized standard material, which we adapt from nonlinear dynamical systems theory.
Next, we establish that deep material networks inherit thermodynamic consistency and stress-strain monotonicity from their phases. These properties root in the definition of the DMN as a tree of hierarchical laminates and contrast with other applications of neural networks to the approximation of material laws, where consistency and monotonicity typically cannot be guaranteed far away from the training set.

In these methods, a large database of multi-axial stress versus strain curves is indispensable for training and cross-validation. However, it is usually formidable to experimentally obtain such curves by noting that, although strain can be easily measured, stress can only be extracted for limited specimens with a simple and uniform stress field upon loading. Moreover, most developed approaches are based upon supervised learning and ignore known physical laws, resulting in limited interpretability and generalization. In this paper, an equilibrium-based convolution neural network (ECNN) is proposed to model the constitutive behavior of hyperelastic materials. Only strain and externally applied force are taken as input for training while the hard-to-measure stress is considered as internal variables. Therefore, a large database can be easily generated with a single non-uniformly deformed specimen with spatially dependent strain. The equation of equilibrium is embedded in the architecture of the ECNN as a constraint to implicitly establish the correspondence between the internal variables and the stress components and, consequently, the constitutive stress–strain relationship.

This formulation follows the classical data-driven paradigm by seeking the solution that obeys the balance of linear momentum and compatibility conditions while remaining consistent with the material data by minimizing a distance measure. Our key point of departure is the introduction of a global manifold embedding as a means to learn the geometrical trend of the constitutive data mathematically represented by a smooth manifold. By training an invertible neural network to embed the data of an underlying constitutive manifold onto a Euclidean space, we reformulate the local distance-minimization problem that requires a computationally intensive combinatorial search to identify the optimal data points closest to the conservation law with a cost-efficient projection step. Meanwhile, numerical experiments performed on path-independent elastic materials of different material symmetries suggest that the geometrical inductive bias learned by the neural network is helpful to ensure more consistent predictions when dealing with data sets of limited sizes or those with missing data.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509622001259

In the present work, an attempt is made to come up with a machine-learning based model that can replicate the predictions anisotropic Yld2000-2d model with homogeneous anisotropic hardening (HAH). For this, a series of modeling problems of increasing complexity is formulated and sequentially addressed using neural network models. It is demonstrated that basic fully-connected neural network models can capture the characteristic non-linearities in the uniaxial stress-strain response such as the Bauschinger effect, permanent softening or latent hardening. A neural network with gated recurrent units (GRUs) and fully-connected layer is proposed for the modeling of plane stress plasticity for arbitrary loading paths.

One of the main drawbacks of such approaches is the lack of a rigorous frame based on the laws of physics. This may render physically inconsistent the predictions of a trained network, which can be even dangerous for real applications.
Here we propose a new class of data-driven, physics-based, neural networks for constitutive modeling of strain rate independent processes at the material point level, which we define as Thermodynamics-based Artificial Neural Networks (TANNs). The two basic principles of thermodynamics are encoded in the network’s architecture by taking advantage of automatic differentiation to compute the numerical derivatives of a network with respect to its inputs. In this way, derivatives of the free-energy, the dissipation rate and their relation with the stress and internal state variables are hardwired in the architecture of TANNs. Consequently, our approach does not have to identify the underlying pattern of thermodynamic laws during training, reducing the need of large data-sets. Moreover the training is more efficient and robust, and the predictions more accurate. Finally and more important, the predictions remain thermodynamically consistent, even for unseen data. Based on these features, TANNs are a starting point for data-driven, physics-based constitutive modeling with neural networks.
We demonstrate the wide applicability of TANNs for modeling elasto-plastic materials, using both hyper- and hypo-plasticity models. Strain hardening and softening are also considered for the hyper-plastic scenario. Detailed comparisons show that the predictions of TANNs outperform those of standard ANNs. Finally, we demonstrate that the implementation of the laws of thermodynamics confers to TANNs high robustness in the presence of noise in the training data, compared to standard approaches.
TANNs’ architecture is general, enabling applications to materials with different or more complex behavior, without any modification.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509620304841

The proposed method first generates a massive number of candidate basis tensor terms and then combines them linearly with fitting coefficients, only a small set of which are non-zero. In this way, the established constitutive models are concise and precise. An innovative hybrid feature selection and regression technique (a combination of high-dimensional Lasso, teaching–learning-based optimization and recursive feature elimination) is proposed to overcome the issues of high correlation and multicollinearity of the terms in this sparse regression problem. Four benchmark tests are introduced to verify that the proposed method established correct models directly from data generated by the benchmarks. A rate-type hypoelastic model is also established with the data generated by the not rate-type benchmarks.

Mechanical failure in the regime near the separator is more severe than toward the current collector. The active particles close to the separator experience deeper charge and discharge over cycles and thus are more mechanically loaded.

Their success is in part due to the excellent mechanical properties of silk and webs that originate from their hierarchical structure of silk, ranging from silk protein, to fibers, to spider webs. Here, we investigate the mechanical behavior of highly complex Cyrtophora Citricola 3D spider web, the architecture of which has been digitally modeled with micron-scale details from images of full-scale laboratory experiments, under stretching and projectile impact, using coarse-grain bead-spring simulations. We show that the interplay between the nonlinear behavior of spider silk and the redundancy of complex 3D spider web structures is crucial for the robustness and resilience of spider webs. The tangle region of the spider web allows prey to fly through and be caught in the dense tent web region, providing food to the spider. It also filters out predators at low impact velocity, and consequently protects the spider located in the tent region.

Unlike all previous finite element studies, where AAAs grow due to prescribed irreversible time-dependent elastin degradation, in this study, protein degradation depends on protease activity. Enzymes degrading collagen and elastin are believed to come from the luminal layer of intraluminal thrombus and the increasing area of chemotactic vasa vasorum in the wall. The geometrical and structural spatiotemporal changes in the aneurysmal wall at the apex and shoulder region of the thrombus-laden aneurysm are explained in detail.

Homogenization entails solving the local elasticity problem computationally which can be prohibitively expensive for a huge image. To mitigate this problem, we use a renormalization method inspired scheme, the hierarchical homogenization method, where a large image is partitioned into smaller subimages. The individual subimages are separately homogenized using periodic boundary conditions, and then assembled into a much smaller intermediate image. The intermediate image is again homogenized, subject to the periodic boundary condition, to find the final homogenized elastic constant of the original image.

Most dry adhesive structures are composed of a tip layer that forms contact and a support structure that transfers load from the far field to this tip structure. Here, we determine the displacement distribution that must be applied on the tip layer to generate an optimum interfacial stress distribution. We realize this through a linear, closed-form optimization framework that uses data obtained from finite element analysis for a few basis cases.

As the simulation evolves, we monitor an adaptation oracle to identify the onset of shear bands and faithfully enrich the macroscopic continuum shear bands into the microscopic-scale grains using the discrete element method. Our algorithm then simulates the shear band region with the discrete method while continuing to simulate the rest of the domain with the continuum method so that the computational cost remains significantly cheaper than a purely discrete solution.

Customized broadband pentamode metamaterials by topology optimization,"['Hao-Wen Dong', 'Sheng-Dong Zhao', 'Xuan-Bo Miao', 'Chen Shen', 'Xiangdong Zhang', 'Zhigao Zhao', 'Chuanzeng Zhang', 'Yue-Sheng Wang', 'Li Cheng']","Volume 152, July 2021, 104407","['Pentamode', 'Topology optimization', 'Single-mode', 'Broadband', 'Anisotropy', 'Metasurfaces', 'Evanescent surface mode']","Pentamode metamaterials (PMs), a kind of metafluids composed of complex solid medium, have shown enormous potential for both elastic wave and underwater acoustic wave manipulation. However, due to the lack of thorough understanding of the formation mechanism, most reported artificial and empirical PMs share very similar topological features, thus depriving the possibility of obtaining rigorous combination of wave parameters that are required to deliver desirable and prescribed properties and functionalities. To tackle this challenge, with the assumption of C2v, C4v and C6v symmetries in both square and triangle lattices, we propose a unified inverse strategy to systematically design and explore a series of novel isotropic or anisotropic PM microstructures through bottom-up topology optimization. Optimized PM microstructures are designed to provide customized effective mass density, elastic modulus, anisotropy degree and pentamode features on demand. We demonstrate that most optimized microstructures possess broadband single-mode range of exclusive longitudinal waves; some even feature record-breaking relative single-mode bandwidths exceeding 150%. Upon shielding lights on the beneficial topological features of the broadband PMs, we extract the main topological features to form simplified PM configurations, i.e., multiple symmetric solid blocks with slender rods, which can induce the multiform multiple-order rotational vibrations or the integration of the low-order rotational vibrations and anisotropic local resonances for the broadband single-mode nature. At a higher design level, we establish a dedicated inverse-design strategy, under the function-macrostructure-microstructure paradigm, to conceive a novel broadband subwavelength underwater pentamode shielding device, which enables the conversion of propagating acoustic wave to the evanescent surface wave mode within the frequency range [1000 Hz, 4000 Hz]. Our study offers new possibilities for the practical realization of broadband PMs and underwater pentamode devices with rigorously tailored effective parameters, thus bring the PM-based technology within reach for practical applications.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509621000909
Mechanics of multi-stimuli temperature-responsive hydrogels,"['Roberto Brighenti', 'Mattia Pancrazio Cosma']","Volume 169, December 2022, 105045","['Multi-stimuli responsiveness', 'Elastomers', 'Swelling', 'Temperature sensitivity', 'pNIPAm hydrogels', 'Photo-thermal effect', 'Morphing']","The temperature-sensitivity of a certain class of elastomeric gels (cross-linked elastomers keen to uptake a fluid into their network, shown for example by poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (pNIPAm) hydrogels), is an interesting property allowing a temperature-controlled swelling. Being the elastomer-fluid affinity sensible to the temperature variation, this implies the possibility to control the amount of fluid uptaken by the material by properly changing its temperature. This capability is particularly interesting in biomedical applications or in the development of sensors whose responsiveness is often required to depend on the environmental temperature. Further, the incorporation of photo-thermal particles into the gel enables the use of light for controlling the material response. In this way, smart untethered multi-stimuli sensors or actuators can be obtained.
In the present study, we consider the mechanical behavior of temperature-sensitive hydrogels and, relying on a theoretical multiphysics-based model accounting for light diffusion, heat generation and transfer, fluid absorption, and mechanics, the response of morphing elements is studied. Light-induced morphing due to photo-thermal effect is also considered and mathematically modeled. Validation and parametric simulations of the emerging deformations confirm the soundness of the approach and demonstrate the wide range of morphing functionalities obtainable by harnessing the temperature-dependent sensitivity of pNIPAm.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509622002241
Extended deformable tension-shear model for graphene layered materials with non-uniform staggering,"['Yan Chen', 'Huasong Qin', 'Huichao Liu', 'Langquan Shui', 'Yilun Liu', 'Xi Chen']","Volume 159, February 2022, 104728","['Non-uniform staggering', 'Deformable tension-shear model', 'Isolated break solution', 'Intralayer force concentration factor']","Current theoretical works on the mechanical behaviors of graphene layered materials are usually limited to the regular staggering. But, more practical staggering modes haven't been paid enough attention. In this work, we extend the deformable tension-shear (DTS) model to non-uniform staggering through two different methods, i.e. eigenvalue method and isolated break method. Then, different staggering modes such as the regular staggering with offset, stair-wise staggering, and non-uniform staggering are studied under the framework of the extended DTS model.

Therefore, the in-plane interaction of adjacent breaks can be ignored for large size of graphene sheet, based on which the in-plane isolated break solution is derived. Then, the interlayer force concentration factor (IFCF) is analytically obtained for arbitrary N graphene layers with r aligned breaks. Further analysis indicates the in-plane isolated break solution gives the upper bound of IFCF for the uniform stair-wise staggering but may underestimate the IFCF for random staggering. The results presented herein comprehensively explore the staggering effect on mechanical behaviors of graphene layered materials which may guide the design of high-performance nacre-like materials.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509621003409
A consistent framework for chemo-mechanical cohesive fracture and its application in solid-state batteries,"['Shahed Rezaei', 'Armin Asheri', 'Bai-Xiang Xu']","Volume 157, December 2021, 104612","['Chemo-mechanical damage', 'Solid-state batteries', 'Solid electrolyte', 'Interface damage']","Damage and fracture can be induced not only by mechanical loading but also due to chemical interactions within a solid. On one hand, species concentration may embrittle or toughen the material and on the other hand, the mechanical state adds additional driving force for diffusion. We propose a chemo-mechanically coupled cohesive fracture model with several novel features. It distinguishes the mode-dependent damage progression and its influence on lithium transport. Coupled with mode-dependent cohesive zone damage, the model recaptures both the normal and tangential transport behavior of lithium at the interface. Moreover, it tackles concentration-dependent crack initiation, various softening behavior, as well as the cyclic damage accumulation. The thermodynamic consistency of the proposed model with the mentioned features is demonstrated. The model is numerically implemented with the finite element method. Numerical results, along with comparison with related experimental data, demonstrate that the model can be applied to study diffusion-induced fracture in general solid ionic conductors in Lithium-ion batteries. In particular, illustrative numerical results are presented for both the intergranular fracture inside active material or solid electrolyte and the interface fracture between active material and solid electrolyte. Furthermore, it is discussed how the solid electrolyte influences the dominant crack patterns. The current contribution is applicable to address similar problems on hydrogen-induced cracking and moister-dependent fracture.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509621002556
Bayesian inference of the spatial distributions of material properties,"['A. Vigliotti', 'G. Csányi', 'V.S. Deshpande']","Volume 118, September 2018, Pages 74-97","[""Occam's razor"", 'Inverse elasticity problems', 'Model selection', 'Nested Sampling']","The inverse problem of estimating the spatial distributions of elastic material properties from noisy strain measurements is ill-posed. However, it is still typically treated as an optimisation problem to maximise a likelihood function that measures the agreement between the measured and theoretically predicted strains. Here we propose an alternative approach employing Bayesian inference with Nested Sampling used to explore parameter space and compute Bayesian evidence. This approach not only aids in identifying the basis function set (referred to here as a model) that best describes the spatial material property distribution but also allows us to estimate the uncertainty in the predictions. Increasingly complex models with more parameters generate very high likelihood solutions and thus are favoured by a maximum likelihood approach. However, these models give poor predictions of the material property distributions with a large associated uncertainty as they overfit the noisy data. On the other hand, Bayes’ factor peaks for a relatively simple model and indicates that this model is most appropriate even though its likelihood is comparatively low. Intriguingly, even for the appropriate model that has a unique maximum likelihood solution, the measurement noise is amplified to give large errors in the predictions of the maximum likelihood solution. By contrast, the mean of the posterior probability distribution reduces the effect of noise in the data and predicts the material properties with significantly higher fidelity. Simpler model selection criteria such as the Bayesian information criterion are shown to fail due to the non-Gaussian nature of the posterior distribution of the parameters. This makes accurate evaluation of the posterior distribution and the associated Bayesian evidence integral (by Nested Sampling or other means) imperative for this class of problems. The output of the Nested Sampling algorithm is also used to construct likelihood landscapes. These landscapes show the existence of multiple likelihood maxima when there is paucity of data and/or for overly complex models. They thus graphically illustrate the pitfalls in using optimisation methods to search for maximum likelihood solutions in such inverse problems.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509617309511
The nonlinear viscoelastic response of suspensions of rigid inclusions in rubber: I—Gaussian rubber with constant viscosity,"['Kamalendu Ghosh', 'Bhavesh Shrimali', 'Aditya Kumar', 'Oscar Lopez-Pamies']","Volume 154, September 2021, 104544","['Elastomers', 'Fillers', 'Finite deformation', 'Homogenization', 'Reinforcement']","A numerical and analytical study is made of the macroscopic or homogenized viscoelastic response of suspensions of rigid inclusions in rubber under finite quasistatic deformations. The focus is on the prototypical case of random isotropic suspensions of equiaxed inclusions firmly embedded in an isotropic incompressible Gaussian rubber with constant viscosity. From a numerical point of view, a robust scheme is introduced to solve the governing initial–boundary-value problem based on a conforming Crouzeix–Raviart finite-element discretization of space and a high-order accurate explicit Runge–Kutta discretization of time, which are particularly well suited to deal with the challenges posed by finite deformations and the incompressibility constraint of the rubber. The scheme is deployed to generate sample solutions for the basic case of suspensions of spherical inclusions of the same (monodisperse) size under a variety of loading conditions. From a complementary point of view, analytical solutions are worked out in the limits: (
i
) of small deformations, (
i
i
) of finite deformations that are applied either infinitesimally slowly or infinitely fast, and (
i
i
i
) when the rubber loses its ability to store elastic energy and reduces to a Newtonian fluid. Strikingly, in spite of the fact that the underlying rubber matrix has constant viscosity, the solutions reveal that the viscoelastic response of the suspensions exhibits an effective nonlinear viscosity of shear-thinning type. The solutions further indicate that the viscoelastic response of the suspensions features the same type of short-range-memory behavior — as opposed to the generally expected long-range-memory behavior — as that of the underlying rubber. Guided by the asymptotic analytical results and the numerical solutions, a simple yet accurate approximate analytical solution for the macroscopic viscoelastic response of the suspensions is proposed.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509621002015
